# 11/5/24 11:30AM - Laying out plans
- Made notes to myself in code of what I would like to do. Specifically around 
what kind of tuner, and the options the user has. 
  - Do they want automatic detection?
  - Maybe someone would like to try and tune based off a standing wave?
  - Maybe they want to pick which note they are trying to specifically measure
    and give a approximate ratio/points value of how close/far off they are.
- Gave just some silly filler code to test with the current venv.
- This project won't accept and command line args since there's no reason to 
accept a file. Everything will be explained in line.
