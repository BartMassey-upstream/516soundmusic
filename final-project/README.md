# About This Project
This project is 3 different types of guitar tuners.

Before running highly recommend creating a python virtual environment.
After that, start the virtual env, then install `requirements.txt` like so:
```BASH
(.venv).../$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

From here you can run the script with the following:

`python project.py` - On Windows

`python3 project.py` - On *most* POSIX like (Mac, Linux) based systems.
