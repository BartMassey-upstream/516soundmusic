# This project is going to be a tuner with several options.
# First is automatic detection.

# Second is to generate a standing wave of specific frequencies

# Third is going to be interactive to select which note and measure what was
# received and give a good or negative response indicating if it was close enough
# or way off. Floating point value +/- of how far off it was?
